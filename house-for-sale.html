          <p>The two-centuries old house underwent a major and sympathetic renovation in 2003/4 to convert it into a boutique guesthouse and family home. It was one of only two mainland Spain properties selected for the inaugural <em>Mr and Mrs Smith</em> European Coast and Country travel book.</p>
          <p>This substantial property comprises very generously proportioned living, entertaining and sleeping accommodation, which combine with double-height ceilings and large French windows to create an uncommon sense of light and space.</p>
          <p>The house is on three floors, with a traditional riyadh-style internal patio and four separate roof terraces, each with outstanding views across the old town of Vejer across to the countryside and the Alcornocales Natural Park beyond. On clear days the Moroccan Rif mountains are visible beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, too.</p>
          <p>Considerable effort has been made to retain -- or uncover -- original features where-ever possible and to use traditional materials to preserve the character of the house, while at the same time modernising the installations with high quality fixtures and fittings, including solar heated water.</p>  
          <p>The house is situated in a quiet pedestrian lane at the heart of the old walled town, midway between the main church and the Plaza de Espa&ntilde;a. The house straddles the lane, which is the only surviving covered street in the region. A zone of tranquility, Vejer's vibrant restaurants and bars are a short stroll from the front door.</p>
          <p>Whether for business or private use, this is a rare opportunity to acquire a prestige property in one of the most sought-after locations in southern Spain.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Building 360m2 (nearly 4000 sqft) plus 124m2 (1350 sqft) of roof terraces.</li>
              <li>Part of a palacial house built c1800 on the site of the ruined Vera Cruz Chapel which was subsequently divided up in the 1930s. Areas of the ground floor c500 years old.</li>
              <li>Completely restored in 2003/4 to a very high standard, retaining original features and traditional materials while completely modernising electrical and plumbing installations, fixtures and fittings.</li>
              <li>Three stories built around a traditional riyadh-style patio.</li>
              <li>5/6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms.</li>
              <li>Two separate entrances, allowing the patio ground floor to be isolated.</li>

            <h3>What other people say</h3>
            <p>Over the years the house has been run either fully or partially as a <a href="http://escondrijo.com">guesthouse</a> which means it has had many visitors&mdash;who have had a lot to say about it.</p>

                    <blockquote><strong>High Jinks</strong> Escondrijo is the perfect micro boutique hotel, with just four spacious Moorish-contemporary suites set around a central patio and winding stairways. ...The hotel is called Escondrijo ('hidden place'), it's in the Callejon Oscuro ('dark alley'), and you really couldn't ask for a more romantic hideaway.<cite>Cond&eacute; Naste Traveller</cite></blockquote>

The bottom of the house is the traditional open patio which serves as public space, with a deliciously cushioned cave of a tv room, an honesty bar and a little internet work station. There's more public space at the top of the house on a rooftop terrace, complete with sleek loungers and the views for which Vejer is justly famous. Plenty of thought (and not a little cash) has gone into the restructuring of Escondrijo's rooms. There are just four of them and each is different, though they share lofty spaciousness, charming original features (beams, stonework) and contemporary, comfortable furnishings.<cite>Travel Intelligence</cite></blockquote>

They have made something that, depending on how you look at it, is either a tiny, intimate and quite stunning boutique hotel or a private home with four rooms set aside for paying guests. And that is the great thing about it. For as long as you are in Vejer&mdash;a month or just a night&mdash;this is your home. And it's not some shonky self-catering duplex with a view of the petrol station; it is a dream of the Spanish Golden Age.<cite>Giles Coren for Mr and Mrs Smith</cite></blockquote>
