            <h1>Buying a house in Spain</h1>
            <h6>Disclaimer:</h6>
            <p>The information below is provided as general guidance about the process of buying a second-hand home in Spain. (There are important differences when buying a new property from a developer.)</p>
            <p>If you have found a house to buy, you don't need an estate agent, but you will want to use a lawyer to represent you. You should seek legal advice before signing a contract or paying any monies. Local bi-lingual lawyers are listed below.</p>
            <p>The process is not difficult and cutting out the estate agent can save you tens of thousands in commission. But if you feel more comfortable paying for someone to walk you through each step, we also list the estate agencies with offices here in town, too.</p>

                  <h2>The main steps</h2>
                  <p>When you have found a property you want to buy and agreed a price, it is customary (but not obligatory) for buyer and seller to sign a pre-sale contract that commits both parties to the sale.</p>
                  <p>This should only be done once background and legal checks are completed, as the buyer normally pays a 10% deposit to the seller which is forfeit if you change your mind. If the seller withdraws, they must return the deposit to the buyer plus a 10% penalty.</p>
                  <p>On the agreed date the sale is completed before the local notary with both parties (or substitutes with power of attorney) and legal representatives present (plus a bank representative if the purchase is financed by a mortgage).</p>
                  <p>Once relevant taxes have been paid the property can then legally be registered in the name of the buyer.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="panel panel--large panel--light">
                    <h3>Background and legal checks</h3>
                    <p>Before committing to the purchase, you need to be satisfied what you are buying is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>what you think it is</li>
                        <li>owned by the people selling it</li>
                        <li>is unencumbered by debts or other restrictions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For this you will need the following documentation from the owner:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the title deeds ('escritura')</li>
                        <li>a receipt for the latest property tax payment</li>
                        <li>where applicable a statement from a residents' community that contributions are up-to-date</li>
                        <li>a statement confirming that there are no tenants with occupancy rights</li>
                        <li>a status declaration where applicable (eg protected low-income housing with restrictions on who can buy the property)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will also need a statement ('nota simple') from the Property Registry. If you are using a lawyer they can request it for you, otherwise you can order a copy on-line at <a href="http://www.registradores.org" target="_blank">www.registradores.org</a> to be emailed to you.</p>
                    <p>You or your legal representative should then re-visit the property armed with the deeds to confirm that they fully describe what it is being offered to you. You may want to organise a builder or architect to accompany you to assess any work that might need doing. Use of a surveyor is not commonplace, but can be arranged via the <a href="http://www.joinricsineurope.eu/en/articles/view/rics-in-continental-europe-6" target="_blank">RICS website</a>.</p>
                    <p>The <em>nota simple</em> will identify the registered owners of the property, of which there may be several, for example members of an extended family. All registered owners must agree to the sale and its terms, and will need to be signatories of any pre-sale contract and the final sale, either directly or via a correctly assigned power of attorney. If an owner is deceased, legal inheritance needs to be correctly established by your lawyer.</p>
                    <p>The <em>nota simple</em> will also detail any debts or charges outstanding against the property that will need to be cleared before agreeing to the purchase.</p>

                    <h3>Costs</h3>
                    <p>Before agreeing a price you need to know that you will be able to meet the additional associated costs. These are summarised below:</p>
                    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
                        <tr>
                          <td>Regional property transfer tax</td>
                          <td>In Andalucia 7%&lt;&euro;400k then 8%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                          <td>Mortgage deed stamp duty<br />(where applicable)</td>
                          <td>0.5-1.0%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                          <td>Notary fees</td>
                          <td>approx 0.5-1.0%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                          <td>Legal fees</td>
                          <td>approx &euro;1000-&euro;2000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                          <td>Property registration fees</td>
                          <td>approx 0.5-1.0%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                          <td>Estate agent commission</td>
                          <td>Typically 2.5%</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Depending on how your purchase is financed there may be mortgage arrangement fees to pay.</p>
                    <p>If you buy direct from the owner you will save 2.5% in estate agent commission, and you will save the seller 2.5% in commission, too, and so should be able to negotiate a lower purchase price.</p>
                    <p class="well">If buying direct expect additional costs to be around 10% of the purchase price. If buying via an estate agent expect fees to be around 12.5%.</p>
